# golang

This is my go lang tutorial

First you need to install go (https://go.dev/)
I am using VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/)
After installing VSCode install go extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go)

The package fmt documentation for printing
https://pkg.go.dev/fmt

Sample Demos are placed on directories

In order to compile and execute samples go to sample directory and execute (go run main.go)

Fisrt Sample Hello world 

golang\Basic-Lang\1-Hello-Word> go run main.go

If some package is needed into import that was not got yet you need to run the following command

golang\Basic-Lang\8-Strings> go get strings
